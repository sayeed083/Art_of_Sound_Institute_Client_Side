## There are the steps i follow to Create this Project:

    -First of All i created a client side and on the first night i done my MeaningFull Navbar & Footer.
    -Then i linked my project with firebase and implement their Authentication and Created A user, Sign in a user, logout a user, Observe the user 
    -Then i started working on Home Page. And From The Given Requirement i got to Know that i have to make a Slider and two section and some extra sections.
    -After That I worked on Slider, At First i implement the React-Responsive-Carousel. But After Some time i learned that i cant use that because it used in bistro-boss project. So I changed it with Daisy Ui Carousel.
    -After That I Implement the data at mongodb and also setup the server side code.
    -After that i posted and also send the user data #User Collection.And its Done.
